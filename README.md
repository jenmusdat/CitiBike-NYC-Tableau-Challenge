# Exploring Expansion
With the plan to expand in the next five years, there are ways in which we may want to go deeper. The greatest ridership is in Manhattan among males. There are many non-subscribers as of 12/31/2020.  As people begin to re-surface in the post Covid era, safety and cleanliness need to be a top priority.

1. In our summer months there were 65,303 (32%) by females as compared to males who were 136,719(67%). Increasing female riders by 20% will bring over 13,000 more rides in the summer months alone. In this article: https://qz.com/quartzy/1745124/why-women-dont-cycle-and-what-cities-can-do-about-it/ safety is touted as one of the largest reasons why women don't commute to work more. We should explore ways in which we can work with the city to create safer ways for bicyclists to travel.
2. According to the census data many of the households in Manhattan are 1-2 people large. In order to increase ridership in areas outside of Manhattan we need to examine ways in which to engage larger households. Perhaps exploring differents types of bikes would increase ridership among larger families.
